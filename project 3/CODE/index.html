        <h2>6:00 AM</h2>
        <p>Here is a constant debate of whether to get up or sleep for another 15 minutes and then get up.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="hour7am">

        <h2>7:00 AM</h2>
        <p>At this point I have decided to get up and be a functioning member of society I just need my body to know
            that.</p>

    <div id="hour8am">

        <h2>8:00 AM</h2>
        <p>I am on my way to class this is the bliss before I realized that I had forgotten my hard drive. Which for
            Tuesdays for me is super important because today I tend to stare at my screen for more than twelve or
            fourteen hours a day, all while soley writing code. Either for Dae In Chung creating interactive things for
            Gen Type or for you, Angelique, creating this timeline while my brain melts out of my ear. </p>

        <h2>9:00 AM</h2>
        <p>I never stop working. Which might be why I am always tired but none the less I tend to work on multiple
            different things in a short amount of time. Not that I am saying that I am a multi-tasker. but from what I
            have seen of my own proccess is that I tend to work better in a constant change in work. So for me I find
            that it is easiest to work on something for an hour and then take a break by working on another project for
            an hour and just rotating through all of the work I have on my plate. At this moment I am working on the
            final for my writing class "Playing With Words", for which I am working on a book of love poetry about my
            past my prestn and future.</p>

        <h2>10:00 AM</h2>
        <p>Here I am just looking for ideas on how to sturcture some of my poetry for my zine. Which leads me into two
            different finals in two different classes. But both are gonna take a lot of work to acomplish in the time
            frame of just one month.</p>

        <h2>11:00 AM</h2>
        <p>Now I am back at it tking notes in Gen Type. Someone told me this is the most difficult class that the
            Graphic Design Department has to offer? I have no idea. Someone wanna answer to the contrary? I mean either
            way I really enjoy this class even though it does hand me my behind mentally and physically. Luckily
            Angelique is super chill so it this class is a good way to end the day.</p>

        <h2>12:00 PM</h2>
        <p>Now I need sustinence. I have this really bad habit of not eating breakfast. What is that about? I mean I
            chalk it up to just being an artist. I need to fix that I really need to work on what my morning routine
            looks like. Right now it is in no way shape or form healthy or sustainable. HELP!!</p>

        <h2>1:00 PM</h2>
        <p>Even more Gen Type notes... I mean really Dae In is one of the nicest people I have ever met. If you get the
            chance take a class with him. I have nothing but good things to say about him. And I am not just saying that
            because this getting displayed for critique.</p>

        <h2>2:00 PM</h2>
        <p>Here we got another break where he allowed us to do what we need to. One of my other professors gave us this
            packet of an article he wrote on John Cage, who was a experimental Musician in the mid-20th Century. Another
            professor I highly recommend is Rod Smith. Great Guy! Super funny. I highly recommend "Playing with Words".

        <h2>3:00 PM</h2>
        <p>After Dae In I went over to station to go and pick up my weaving off of my loom so I could begin to put
            another warp and begin to learn how to weave double cloth... When you see this you will be blown away. It is
            amazing.</p>
